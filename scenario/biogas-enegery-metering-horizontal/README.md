# Blockchain-based collaborative emissions metering for biogas production and combined heat and power plants (CHP/BHKW in german)





## 1. Scenario description
The local production of biogas and the consumption by a CHP plant prevents greenhousegas emissions by landfill gas (e.g., methan) (CDM: AMS-III.D.), and may serve as a stand-alone supply of heat and electricity (e.g., for farms). Depending of the actual plant size, the self-usage or delivery of biogas to to third parties, the operation demands the maintenance of certain metering and documentation tasks. By design edium and small-scale CHP plants have a lower efficiency then centralizedlarge scale CHP plants. While thermical/chemical processes getting continuously improved, the actual process of metering and documentation remains mainly manual and highly reptitive. The collaboration of numerous operators (e.g., farms) to scale-up the process of metering and reporting can be a driver for lower costs in this regard.
